Consideration notes of cv::remap

A mapping table of cv::remap is defined on destination nodes node-by-node

Creating test images, given mapping table is defined on source nodes node-by-node.
It is necessary to convert the table to that on destination nodes.

Source node 2D index (u, v)
mapped destination coordinate is (Xi.Xf, Yi.Yf), where
    Xi: integer part of a horizontal coordinate of the destination plane
    Xf: fractional part of a horizontal coordinate of the destination plane
    Yi: integer part of a vertical coordinate of the destination plane
    Yf: fractional part of a vertical coordinate of the destination plane

Reliable destination node must have four neighboring source nodes. Each destination node
is indexed by (X, Y), 2D integer coordinate.

Scanning the source plane mapping table m(u, v) = (Xi.Xf, Yi.Yf), 
the neighboring source node table Sn(X, Y) is filled as follows.
Sn(x,y) element is BL_2i16_t[4]
